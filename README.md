This template is described in the Lagom gRPC Example (Java) guide

This Greeter example illustrates using Lagom gRPC as the communication mechanism between two Lagom services.
Within 30 minutes, you should be able to download and run the example and use this guide to understand how the example is constructed.

This guide assumes basic knowledge about Lagom-gRPC and Lagom but it also tries to make the amount of previous knowledge as small as possible. Feel free to refer to the Akka-gRPC reference guide or the Lagom documentation for extra details.
