This template is described in the Lagom-gRPC-Restaurant Example (Java) guide

This Restaturant example illustrates using Lagom gRPC as the communication mechanism between two Lagom services i.e MenuService and OrderService.

This guide assumes basic knowledge about Lagom-gRPC and Lagom but it also tries to make the amount of previous knowledge as small as possible. Feel free to refer to the Akka-gRPC reference guide or the Lagom documentation for extra details.
